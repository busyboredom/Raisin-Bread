# Poppop's Raisin Bread Recipe

## Ingrediants

- 2 tablespoons of olive oil 
- 3 tablespoons of honey
- 1/2 cup of oats 
- 2 1/4 cup of bread flower 
- 1/2 cup of whole wheat flower

- 2 teaspoon of instant yeast 
- 1 cup raisins (added in by kneeding just before making the roll for the 
  5"x9" bread pan).

## Directions

1. Mix all ingrediants (except for raisins) and let rise. I like to use a
  bread maker (set to "specialty dough").

2. Kneed the raisons in, and then place roll in greased 5"x9" bread pan.

3. Let rise until the dough has approximately doubled in size.  

4. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18 minutes. Place a foil tent over it and bake
